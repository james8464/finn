# Plumb

**Plumb** is a planned iPhone-first strength-training companion. Put the phone where its camera can see a supported exercise, do a set, and review one specific observation linked to the movement it saw. Try another set and compare. The product is designed to say when the view is too weak to support a cue.

The iPhone is the core experience. Apple Watch workout data and spoken feedback through AirPods are optional additions. Apple Foundation Models may help phrase validated observations on eligible devices; the coaching facts come from camera pose analysis and exercise-specific rules, with a non-generative fallback. Plumb is a fitness aid, not medical advice or a guarantee of safe technique.

**Current state (11 October 2026):** the repository contains the branded Xcode starter, product and implementation plans, and a tested first slice of the squat analysis engine: rep boundaries, evidence checks, and a provisional cue rule. The visible app still introduces the concept. Live camera capture, the workout flow, Watch integration, spoken feedback, subscriptions, and workout history are not implemented. The challenge goal is a tested iPhone camera-to-cue experience for a side-view bodyweight squat, a credible product pitch, and an App Store Connect build submission; public availability depends on further review and validation.

Project for the October 2026 Build Challenge: Unaite, MWM, Apple & ⌘+F.
